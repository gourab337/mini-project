    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>
    This folder contains the Control Center Software Development Kit, a set of
    components that enables IndigoVision IP Video Systems to be integrated with
    other systems and applications, such as video streaming, alarm management
    and access control systems.
    </p>

    <p>The SDK consists of the following components:</p>

    <ol>
    <li>IndigoVision Binding Kit</li>
    <li>Control Center Automation Interface</li>
    <li>IvSnap Utility</li>
    <li>Control Center Custom Objects Plugin Interface</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>IndigoVision Binding Kit</h1>
    <p>
        The IndigoVision Binding Kit 2 (IvBind2) enables binding software to be developed that
        integrates external systems such as alarm management and access control systems with
        the IndigoVision Security Management System. It enables developers to write applications
        that forward external alarm events to, or receive zone (or detector) events from, an
        IndigoVision Alarm Server (NVR-AS). Zone events can notify state changes such as
        alarmed, acknowledged or cleared. IvBind provides a C API as well as a COM
        interface to allow scripts or applications to be written in a wide variety of
        programming languages.
    </p>

    <p>
    See the Binding Kit readme for more details.
    </p>

    <h1>Control Center Automation Interface</h1>
    <p>
    The Control Center Automation Interface is a COM interface, built into the
    Control Center application itself. This folder contains documentation
    detailing how to use the Control Center Automation Interface to write
    external scripts and programs that carry out a number of operations on the
    Control Center application. These include starting and stopping video, and
    setting the target for PTZ keyboards connected to the local PC.
    </p>

    <h1>IvSnap Utility</h1>

    <p>
    The IvSnap Utility enables a series of snapshot images to be obtained from a
    video camera. These snapshots can then be displayed by another application,
    for example on a web page for a traffic website.
    </p>
    <p>
    The IvSnap utility allows you to grab frames from a specified camera at
    regular intervals and save them to a destination directory in JPEG format.
    </p>

    <h1>Control Center Custom Objects Plugin Interface</h1>

    <p>
    The Control Center Custom Objects Plugin Interface allows plugins to be
    developed that extend the objects available in Control Center. These
    custom objects can represent external devices, and allow operators to
    interface with those devices through objects placed in sites or on maps
    within Control Center. Custom Object plugins must conform to the documented
    API.
